We could sleep for a couple of hours (daytime flight), with the blinds down as they should be (no point booking a window seat in my view).

Fat chance. An hour and a half after takeoff we were finally served a drink and meal together. I keep reading how well BA are now doing, but on both legs of this trip the crew were awful. The club suites are a great improvement but if the staff make no effort, what’s the point? On a positive note we were told my wife’s seat was broken and could not recline. I was going to swop, but at the gate they found her another. Prior to this we received an email within 30 minutes of check in with a healthy portion of Avios already added to our account.

C Barton (United Kingdom) 21st February 2025",✅ Trip Verified |   Prior to boarding a gate agent seemed to pick on elderly people and asked them to check in relatively small bags. By contrast the same staff member looked the other way to a boisterous group of 20 somethings all of whom had large amounts of luggage. London Gatwick to Marrakech with British Airways was rather disappointing. The flight is just over 3 hours and during this flight passengers in economy were offered a tiny packet of digestive biscuits. No water was offered other than a cabin crew member walking through the aisle with a bottle of mineral water and plastic cups. She claimed she ran out of water and so many passengers did not even get that miserly offering. There was no route map on this A320. The captain made only 2 very brief announcements. When I needed to use the lavatory one cabin crew member rudely drew the curtain as she was sitting behind the lavatories with one of her colleagues – they were loudly talking about their boyfriends and ignored an elderly man who was struggling to open the small door to the lavatory. I shall add that the lavatory was unclean and had water on the floor. One concern was the seemingly casual approach to the safety demonstration. Disembarkation was not well managed either. This route is very competitive and these days one has a lot of choice. I will not use British Airways on this route.,A320
3,"""they still haven't replied""","

E Vandoon (Netherlands) 18th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied. Every time I contact them they claim they have such a huge backlog that it takes long to process them. ",Business

John Prescott (United Kingdom) 14th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified | First the good news, the club suites are such a huge improvement over the old business seats I hope I never see one again. The not so good news I’m afraid to say was the flight itself. The food has really gone downhill since my last flight, presumably this is a cost cutting measure. If other airlines can offer a really decent quality meal why can’t an airline of BA’s stature? I’ve always thought that a good crew can make up for all the shortcomings but not this time. The crew member looking after me could not have been more bored and was obviously just going through the motions. They couldn’t even be bothered to say cheerio, and I’m not sure I would have answered if they did. Here’s hoping my return is a more satisfying experience.",A350-1000

Paul Lee (United Kingdom) 1st February 2025","✅ Trip Verified |   London Heathrow to Male In new business class. BA continues to get its mojo back starting with a classy lounge serving innovative, and interesting, quality pre-flight food (beetroot scotch eggs?). Excellent wine (Whispering Angel). Presentation of on-board food has always been a bit hit and miss with BA, but on this occasion it was tasty and OK. Friendly and efficient on board crew. Smile, treat them respectfully, and as equals.  On time flight and early arrival.  Only awarding a 9 because we were bussed from A-C gates, otherwise a really enjoyable experience.",Boeing 777

E Vandoon (Netherlands) 18th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam.

Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.

We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate.

E Vandoon (Netherlands) 18th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied.

John Prescott (United Kingdom) 14th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified | First the good news, the club suites are such a huge improvement over the old business seats I hope I never see one again. The not so good news I’m afraid to say was the flight itself. The food has really gone downhill since my last flight, presumably this is a cost cutting measure. If other airlines can offer a really decent quality meal why can’t an airline of BA’s stature? I’ve always thought that a good crew can make up for all the shortcomings but not this time. The crew member looking after me could not have been more bored and was obviously just going through the motions.

E Vandoon (Netherlands) 18th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam.

We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers..

E Vandoon (Netherlands) 18th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied.

Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied.

We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers..

E Vandoon (Netherlands) 18th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied.

We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers..

We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection.

We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate.

When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam.

According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate.

We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers..

We could sleep for a couple of hours (daytime flight), with the blinds down as they should be (no point booking a window seat in my view).

Fat chance. An hour and a half after takeoff we were finally served a drink and meal together. I keep reading how well BA are now doing, but on both legs of this trip the crew were awful. The club suites are a great improvement but if the staff make no effort, what’s the point? On a positive note we were told my wife’s seat was broken and could not recline. I was going to swop, but at the gate they found her another. Prior to this we received an email within 30 minutes of check in with a healthy portion of Avios already added to our account.

982,"""not use British Airways on this route""","

C Barton (United Kingdom) 21st February 2025",✅ Trip Verified |   Prior to boarding a gate agent seemed to pick on elderly people and asked them to check in relatively small bags. By contrast the same staff member looked the other way to a boisterous group of 20 somethings all of whom had large amounts of luggage. London Gatwick to Marrakech with British Airways was rather disappointing. The flight is just over 3 hours and during this flight passengers in economy were offered a tiny packet of digestive biscuits. No water was offered other than a cabin crew member walking through the aisle with a bottle of mineral water and plastic cups. She claimed she ran out of water and so many passengers did not even get that miserly offering. There was no route map on this A320. The captain made only 2 very brief announcements. When I needed to use the lavatory one cabin crew member rudely drew the curtain as she was sitting behind the lavatories with one of her colleagues – they were loudly talking about their boyfriends and ignored an elderly man who was struggling to open the small door to the lavatory. I shall add that the lavatory was unclean and had water on the floor. One concern was the seemingly casual approach to the safety demonstration. Disembarkation was not well managed either. This route is very competitive and these days one has a lot of choice. I will not use British Airways on this route.,A320

E Vandoon (Netherlands) 18th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified |   I flew from Amsterdam to Las Vegas with a layover in Heathrow in November 2024. The day we were flying the weather wasn't great. Since I was on business I really needed to get to Las Vegas, we anticipated on it and checked early if our flight was still leaving. We would have had ample time to catch an earlier flight to Heathrow or even take the train when we checked. According to google our flight was delayed and we would miss our connection. According to the staff of British airways the flight was not delayed and there was no reason for panic. When we got to the airport there was still nothing wrong with our connection. An hour before we were supposed to leave it was announced that the plane wasn't there yet and we would have a major delay. We called customer service and they told us to just go to London and see from there. We wanted some kind of assurance that we could be placed in a hotel since we would not be making our connecting flight and they refused to give those. In the end we found a direct flight the next day and convinced British airways to book that for us. Even though they wanted to connect us through 3 additional layovers.. This resulted in approximately a 24 hour delay in our trip. On our way back home they lost our luggage at the gate and took approximately 2 hours to find it at a wrong gate. On the way back we tried to check in through the online portal. My colleague was able to check in just fine but I couldn't. I was afraid I was overbooked and contacted customer service 3 times.  When I got to the airport I was overbooked and the ground staff had the nerve to tell me it was my fault for not checking in online. Since we were seated in premium economy I could be moved to regular economy but that does mean someone in economy was bumped off the plane. When we got to London our flight back to Amsterdam was delayed. This was because there were disabled people on board of the plane still and there were not enough wheelchairs to get them off. It took approximately 2 hours before boarding could begin.  When we finally boarded we were told we needed a new pilot because the old pilot had now made too many hours waiting around to still fly us to Amsterdam. Arriving in Amsterdam they had left my luggage in Las Vegas so I needed to wait for another week before that was given back to me. Afterwards I have made a claim as soon as possible for my delays and hotel costs, it's been almost 3 months and they still haven't replied. Every time I contact them they claim they have such a huge backlog that it takes long to process them. ",Business

John Prescott (United Kingdom) 14th February 2025","✅ Trip Verified | First the good news, the club suites are such a huge improvement over the old business seats I hope I never see one again. The not so good news I’m afraid to say was the flight itself. The food has really gone downhill since my last flight, presumably this is a cost cutting measure. If other airlines can offer a really decent quality meal why can’t an airline of BA’s stature? I’ve always thought that a good crew can make up for all the shortcomings but not this time. The crew member looking after me could not have been more bored and was obviously just going through the motions. They couldn’t even be bothered to say cheerio, and I’m not sure I would have answered if they did. Here’s hoping my return is a more satisfying experience.",A350-1000
